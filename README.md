# Spring Lemon (under construction)

When developing a *Single Page Application* or a *REST API* using Spring Framework and Spring Boot, we need to do several subtle configuratios. We also need laying out some good patterns to handle validation, security etc. in an elegant manner.

These configurations and patterns could be reused in majority of the applications, with or without some custom configurations. How about someone writing this common code as a configurable and extensible library, which you can include in your pom and start coding your business logic rightaway? Or, you can at least learn the best practices from the library, and use those in your code?

Welcome to Spring Lemon. Along with all the essential configurations and patterns for developing Single Page Application backends and REST APIs, it also has a production-ready user module with features like sign up, sign in, validate email, change password, etc., which you can use in your applications. For majority of applications, Spring Lemon can be used with or without customization. But, if you don't find it suitable for your application, feel free to fork it, or just roll out your own library by learning its patterns and practices. Better yet, be a contributor to this library!
